Securing Cookies
HTTP Only Flag:

This flag prevents JavaScript from accessing or modifying cookies. By setting this flag to true, the browser ensures that JavaScript on the client-side cannot manipulate cookies, protecting against XSS attacks.

Secure Flag:

The Secure flag ensures that cookies are only transmitted over secure (HTTPS) connections. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, where attackers could intercept cookies if sent over an insecure connection (HTTP). This flag should always be set to true on websites using HTTPS.
